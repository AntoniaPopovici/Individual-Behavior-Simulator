<h1>Individual Behavior Simulation Program in a Virtual Environment</h1>

<p>This is a program that simulates the behavior of individuals in a virtual environment. Each individual has certain attributes (type, age, energy) and can interact with other individuals through methods such as attacking, feeding, or reproducing.</p>

<p>The "Individual" class has a constructor and a copy constructor for initializing the attributes, an assignment method for copying objects, and a series of public methods for setting and getting attribute values. The most important methods of the class are the private ones, which simulate the behavior of individuals.</p>

<p>The "feed" method increases the energy level of the individual by a random value between 1 and 10. The "reproduce" method checks if there are neighboring individuals that can be multiplied and creates a new individual if the conditions are met. The "attack" method simulates the aggressive behavior of individuals and can make them fight and kill each other. The "age" method increases the age of the individual and causes it to die if it reaches the maximum age of 99. The "die" method changes the individual's life status to "dead".</p>
